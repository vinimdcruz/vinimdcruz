## Hi there!

I'm Vinicius, a lifelong software developer, always ready to explore, learn and craft elegant and efficient solutions.

💼 Currently seeking my next opportunity, where I’m eager to learn, share knowledge, and deliver impactful results.

🤝 I’ve just started my first open-source project—a tool called [neogrow](https://github.com/vinimdcruz/neogrow), designed to help parents of neonatal babies track their child's growth and development, and you’re invited to contribute.

## Hi there!

I'm Vinicius, a lifelong software developer, always ready to explore, learn and craft elegant and efficient solutions.

💼 Currently, I work at Afya iClinic, developing digital solutions that empower healthcare professionals to optimize their performance and deliver exceptional care to their patients.

🤝 I'm enthusiastic about open-source collaboration, where we can learn, grow, and build together.

Hi!

I'm Vinicius, and I'm always ready to explore, learn, and craft efficient solutions.

💼 Currently working at Oliveira Trust, learning, sharing my knowledge, and doing my best to deliver impactful results.

💻 I have experience working with JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript, along with frameworks like React and Node.js, focusing on building scalable and maintainable applications.

🤝 I’ve just started my first open-source project—a tool called [neogrow](https://github.com/vinimdcruz/neogrow), designed to help parents of neonatal babies track their child's growth and development, and you’re invited to contribute.

Here are some stats about my main languages I have worked with here on GitHub:
